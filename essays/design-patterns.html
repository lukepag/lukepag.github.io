<p>I have many passions, with Computer Science being a strong one of mine. However, one of my biggest passions would have to be music, and I never thought I’d find any correlation between the two… Until now. I have played music in a band, as a soloist, and just as a hobby for as long as I can remember and I believe that in the realm of software development, design patterns are the intricate melodies and harmonies that compose the symphony of code.</p>

<p>Imagine software design as a grand orchestral performance, each section representing different design patterns. The conductor, similar to a skilled architect or engineer, harmonizes these patterns to create a masterpiece. Every person in the orchestra has a purpose, just as each design pattern has its purpose.</p>

<h1 id="my-experience">My experience</h1>
<p>An example of this would be the ‘Singleton’. The ‘Singleton,’ which is seen as a fundamental design pattern, acts as the soloist in a symphony, ensuring that a class has only one instance globally accessible. It’s like a primary musician standing out with a distinctive melody, leading the ensemble. This pattern finds its place in scenarios requiring a single, shared resource such as a group of database connections. I believe that Singletons are extremely powerful, as I have utilized them in various different projects for an internship that I was apart of this semester. It proved itself to be an excellent tool for global variables and not having to duplicate data.</p>

<h1 id="transcend-your-code">Transcend your code!</h1>
<p>Design patterns aren’t just lines of code; they’re the melodious arrangements that transcend your code into something extraordinary. Their presence in my symphony of code has transformed the typical rigid structures we may be used to into harmonious compositions, crafting elegant solutions while ensuring scalability and maintainability.</p>
