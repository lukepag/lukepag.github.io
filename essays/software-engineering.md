# Nerds are cool
Before I knew what coding and programming was, I assumed everything just revolved under the title Software Engineering. I was always intriguied on the limitless possibilities that this field offers and still find myself captivated by the lifestyle that Software Engineers live. Although sitting at a desk programming for hours may not sound like fun to many others, it was and still is a dream of mine. What intrigues me most is the sheer potential to innovate, solve complex problems, and create solutions that will have a tangible impact on the lives of everyone around us.

# Looking forward to this class!
With this Software Engineering class, I am finally able to utilize and apply the skills I've learned while also cultivating an even more diverse set of skills. I'm excited to deepen my knowledge on programming as a whole and while I do have some experience with Software Engineering, I am eager to keep improving and learning more as we tread through this class.

Moreover, I recognize that Software Engineering is a collaborative effort, often requiring you to work in teams to build large-scale projects. With this exposure to working with a team, which I have not had too much experience with, I am excited to develop strong communication skills and learn how to present my ideas to my team, as well as learning from others ideas.
