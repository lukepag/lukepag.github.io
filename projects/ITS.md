summary: "My team and I at ITS created a project called UH Groupings"
---

In UH Groupings, our job was to create a website that allowed staff to group other staff members into various groups that gave them certain attributes, qualities, and included/excluded them from certain events and meetings.

Eventually, this website will be used by the University of Hawaii at Manoa and our job is to keep improving it until it's ready to be released
