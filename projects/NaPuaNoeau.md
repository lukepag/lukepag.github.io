summary: "I, along with two other talented students, participated in teaching students from middle school to high school about computer science in a program called Na Pua No'eau"
---

Teaching the next generation of students is such an important part in allowing these kids to figure out what their passions and interests are. Without a proper education, kids growing up will not have the opportunities to find what these passions may be. I had the immense pleasure of teaching two groups of middle-high schoolers from neighboring islands about computer science.

Over the course of a month, we taught these kids various programming languages, how to build their own websites, building their own keyboards/computers, and other various projects.
