summary: "Was apart of a surf team where I did a couple heats and discovered my passion for surfing"
---

I've been surfing since I was in the 5th grade, but I never realized how strong my passion was for surfing until I joined my first surf team. I participated in heats, practiced at 5:00am two-three times a week before school, and made lots of new friends

Although computer science is my major and what I want to do for my career, surfing is something I can't live without. It is my number one source of happiness and is something that made me who I am today.
